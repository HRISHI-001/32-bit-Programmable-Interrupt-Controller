A Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is a critical component in modern computing systems, responsible for managing interrupt requests from peripheral devices and ensuring that the CPU addresses these interrupts based on their priority. Traditional PICs, such as the 8259A, utilize 8-bit registers and can manage a limited number of interrupt requests, often leading to bottlenecks in complex systems.

This project presents the design and implementation of a 32-bit PIC aimed at enhancing the efficiency and scalability of interrupt management. The proposed PIC supports up to 32 peripheral devices, significantly increasing the number of manageable interrupts. The architecture includes a priority resolver that prioritizes interrupt requests based on predefined levels, ensuring that high-priority tasks are handled promptly. A notable innovation in this design is the integration of the End-of-Interrupt (EOI) signal into the acknowledgement signal, simplifying the architecture and reducing processing overhead. Additionally, the design incorporates efficient read operations for retrieving interrupt data, ensuring that the CPU can quickly access and process interrupt information. The design and simulation were conducted using Xilinx Vivado 2023.2, with results demonstrating efficient resource utilization and minimal processing overhead. The PIC effectively managed multiple interrupt requests, masking operations, and sequential processing in various test scenarios.

In conclusion, the 32-bit PIC designed in this project enhances the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of modern computing systems. Future enhancements will focus on implementing dynamic priority configuration and ensuring compatibility with multicore processors, further broadening the scope and applicability of this PIC. These developments highlight the project's commitment to addressing contemporary technological challenges and underscore its potential impact on high-performance and real-time processing applications.
